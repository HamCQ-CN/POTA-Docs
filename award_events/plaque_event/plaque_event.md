# POTA Plaque Event
The Parks on the Air plaque event is run in conjunction with the Summer Support Your Parks Event, to encourage individuals and clubs to get out in the parks and make contacts. Since 2018 this even has rewarded activators and hunters with plaques based on their activity during the weekend event.

The plaques awarded are no ordinary QSO party plaques! During this event participants can earn premium series plaques, on black piano-finish wood. The award is laser engraved on an 8x10 textured black aluminum plate with a silver Florentine border - these are high quality awards that any operator should be proud to hang on the wall of their shack!

## Event Date and Time
The 3rd full weekend of July (UTC).
