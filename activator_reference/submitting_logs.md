## Submitting Logs to Parks on the Air
Prepare the log files following the [POTA logging requirements](/docs/rules.html#logging-requirements) and the [POTA-specific ADIF usage.](/docs/activator_reference/ADIF_for_POTA_reference.html)

Submit the ADIF log files in one of two ways:

1.  Upload from [My Log Uploads](https://pota.app/#/user/logs) page of pota.app. This option has been available since July 2022.
    * This video by Matt N3NWV gives an excellent overview of how to use the uploader.

2. If unable to use the self uploader, the second option is to email your log coordinator, attaching the ADIF file. When submitting logs via email, follow the filename format: `callsign@parkNumber-activationDdate.adi` (e.g., KA8H@K-1515-20201127.adi). If the park spans multiple states, include the activation state (i.e., W8MSC@K-4239-20181231-US-MI.adi). Each callsign district has a log coordinator; email to the address corresponding to the number in your callsign.

    - K1@parksontheair.com
    - K2@parksontheair.com
    - K3@parksontheair.com
    - K4@parksontheair.com
    - K5@parksontheair.com
    - K6@parksontheair.com
    - K7@parksontheair.com
    - K8@parksontheair.com
    - K9@parksontheair.com
    - K0@parksontheair.com

Often an activation can have multiple log files. This can result from a club sending a log file for each operating position or if a station uses different logging software at various times during activation. Contacts for digital modes may be exported directly from the software running the radio.

It is recommended to combine logs from a single activation into a single ADIF file where applicable (same park and same station callsign), although not required. A single ADIF file may contain multiple UTC days.

## Fixing errors

Sometimes you'll realize errors in the log only after submitting; request the log be removed using the "Request Support" button located next to the erroneous log at [https://pota.app/#/user/logs](https://pota.app/#/user/logs). Once the help desk removes the old log, upload the new corrected log.
