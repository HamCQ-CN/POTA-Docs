# Award Certificates Info

This section is **Under Construction**.

Parks on the Air recognizes the dedication of its Activators and Hunters by issuing certificates based on certain types and volumes of activities. An excellent summary and sample images of these certificates are [available here.](https://parksontheair.com/pota-awards/)

The following sections of this documentation are dedicated to providing additional details for how the certificates work, how and when they are issued, and who is eligible.

For Activator awards, the activator can be either a solo operator, or the operator for a [club activity.](/docs/activator_reference/activator_guide_clubs.html)

These certificates are issued to the user, not the callsign. As long as all callsigns held by the user are set up in the [user's account](https://pota.app/#/user/account) with appropriate dates, QSOs made by the user accumulate across all callsigns to count towards the awards. When downloaded for viewing or printing, awards will display whichever callsign is listed as the users Primary callsign at the time the award is downloaded.

All time and calendar based awards are determined using UTC dates and times, unless otherwise noted.

## All Administrative Units (Locations) Awards

The awards in this category are based on activities occurring from each of the primary administrative divisions within a country, entity, program, or group thereof. (I.e. States, Provinces, Districts, Regions, Prefectures, Territories, etc.) In the POTA system these primary divisions are often referred to as 'Locations'.

Parks on the Air generally uses the primary subdivisions detailed at [statoids.com](http://www.statoids.com/) except in some rare occurrences where the the divisions on a specified country's page do not align with our DX entities. (i.e. Statoids has a single page for the United Kingdom, but Parks on the Air breaks these down into the individual entities of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.)

These awards are issued automatically, and should appear on the user's awards page within 48 hours of the associated logs being uploaded.

### All Administrative Units (Locations) Activator

## All References in Administrative Unit (Location) Awards

The awards in this category are granted based on activities from each park within a given Location (Primary Administrative Division.)
There are a very large volume of locations in the POTA system, so certificates have not yet been created for many of them. The awards detailed below are being issued via a combination of fully-automated and partially automated methods, meaning that you do not need to take any action to be granted these awards, but please allow up to 1 month from earning the award for your certificate to be prepared.

### All References in Administrative Unit (Location) Activator Awards

The awards in this category are issued when an Activator has completed at least 1 activation in every reference within the listed location. Parks that were successfully activated, but later became inactive parks, count as wild-cards.

## RaDAR
RaDAR, or Rapid Deployment Amateur Radio, is an award scheme that is provided in conjuction & by agreement with the [offical RaDAR Ops Program](https://radarops.co.za/). If you are doing RaDAR activations as part of Parks on the Air, we strongly encourage you to also participate in the offical RaDAR program, and it's events. The full set of RaDAR rules is available at the offical RaDAR site. While the scoring and logging requirements for RaDAR are not directly applicable to Parks on the Air, please be sure to familiarize yourself with that program and it's rules, and be certain that your POTA RaDAR operations are within the spirit of the offical RaDAR Ops Program, and within it's rules wherever applicable.

The goal of RaDAR is to demonstrate your ability to quickly change locations and re-deploy your amature station. POTA issues RaDAR certificates based on the number of transitions a POTA operator makes within 24 hours (i.e. POTA only provides RaDAR certificates for RaDAR Category A activities.)

* The 24 hour period beings at the time of the first logged QSO in the first applicable activation
* The 24 hour period ends at the time of the last logged QSO in the last applicable activation

Refer to the below screenshot of the RaDAR application as you read the rest of the inforamtion regarding RaDAR certificate application:

![RaDAR Application Form](/assets/images/radar.png)

* Each line in the application form represents a transition (move), and the operating position where that transation (move) ended.
* One Parks on the Air Activation can be represented in multiple lines on the application form, but multiple Activations cannot be grouped into a single line.
    * example 1 - Transitions can be made within a single park/activation, in large parks, so the activation would be split across lines on the form.
    * example 2 - A stop at a single location, that crosses UTC days is 2 Activations by POTA's definition, and needs to be entered on two seperate lines.
* **Reference** is the Park ID for the location (operating position) where the transition ended.
* **# Contacts** is the number of contacts applicable to the RaDAR operating position. Minimum required is 5, maximum permitted is the number of confirmed QSOs for the Activation.
* **Date of First Contact, Time of First Contact, Time of Last Contact** are the respective dates and times of the contacts made at the listed operating position.
* **Method of Travel** is the method used to complete the transition to the listed listed operating position.
* **Meters Traveled** is the the distance that was traveled to get to the Reference listed on the same line.
    * i.e. you are recording the travel distance TO this stop, not the distance traveled after this stop.
    * The distance traveled to be considered an elibible transition varies based on the method of transportation.
    * The distance traveled to the first location is from the operator's 'starting' location (generally the operator's home.)

        |Transportation Method                                                                   |Required Meters Traveled |
        |Motorized Transport (Vehicles, motorcycles, motorboats, e-bikes greater than 250 watts) |6,000                    |

        |Wheelchairs or mobility devices                                                         |500                      |

Depending on the number of valid transitions submitted on the application form, RaDAR certificates are issued at the following levels:

|Award Name   |Description                                                              |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
